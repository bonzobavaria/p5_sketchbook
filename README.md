# p5 sketchbook

## Welcome

This is my sketchbook for p5.js sketches. If you're new to p5, this project
demonstrates a good structure for a p5 portfolio. 

### To install: 

First, clone and `cd` into the sketchbook, then make sure you have
`http-server` installed. You can install it globally (which I prefer) with `npm
i -g http-server` or locally by running `npm i http-server` inside the project
directory. 

Once you `npm start`, the project index will automatically open in your default
browser. Select any directory to open the sketch inside.

### Guidelines

The project contains `p5.js` and `p5.min.js`, which every project will use one
of, and an `addons` folder for extra **p5** modules such as `p5.sound.js`.  So
far I've added one non-p5 script, `ramda.min.js`. My preference will be to keep
this sketchbook focused on **p5**, so extra modules will be limited and
installed individually per sketch.
