# p5 sketchbook

This is my sketchbook for p5.js sketches. If you're new to p5, this project
demonstrates a good structure for a p5 portfolio. 

### Get Started

First, clone and `cd` into the sketchbook, then make sure you have
`http-server` installed. You can install it globally (which I prefer) with `npm
i -g http-server` or locally by running `npm i http-server` inside the project
directory. 

Once you `npm start`, the project index will automatically open in your default
browser. Select any directory to open the sketch inside.
